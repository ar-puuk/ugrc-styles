# ugrc-styles

Alternate MapLibre styles for [UGRC](https://gis.utah.gov/)'s Lite vector basemap
(`VectorHillshade`, `LiteBase`, `LiteLabels`), for [MapLibre](https://maplibre.org/). This repo
holds more than one style, developed side by side:

- **shadow** — a dark restyling built from [Protomaps](https://protomaps.com/)' dark flavor.
- **sol** — a warm light restyling based on [CARTO](https://carto.com/)'s Voyager basemap colors,
  using UGRC's `Vector_Overlay` sprite (the colorful icon set built for their Hybrid basemap)
  in place of LiteBase/LiteLabels' own muted grayscale icons.

**[Try it live →](https://ar-puuk.github.io/ugrc-styles/)**
A browser-only visual editor for customizing any built-in theme (or your own uploaded style):

- Browse layers grouped by service and by the same groups UGRC's own layer ids encode (e.g.
  "PARKS & REC"), search/filter by id, and reorder layers within a service.
- Edit colors/opacity/numbers/enums/filters/zoom ranges, with a raw-JSON fallback for anything
  the visual editor doesn't cover. A property that's split across several zoom-band layers (common
  in UGRC's own data — e.g. one road class split into a dozen-plus copies) can be edited once and
  applied to every other layer that currently shares that exact value, instead of repeating the
  edit by hand.
- Click the inspect tool, then hover or click anywhere on the map to see which layer is drawing
  what's under the cursor, and jump straight to it in the editor.
- A "Compare against" picker in the header swipes your in-progress edit against any theme, UGRC's
  own live basemap, or your upload, with an address search box and a live coordinates readout on
  either map.
- Crash-recovery autosave, light/dark/system theme, and resizable side panels.
- Download either one combined style JSON or the 3 separate
  `VectorHillshade`/`LiteBase`/`LiteLabels` files matching how UGRC actually hosts these.

Nothing you do here feeds back into this repo's build — see
[`STYLE_EDITOR_PLAN.md`](STYLE_EDITOR_PLAN.md) for the design.

## What this is

UGRC publishes three public Esri vector-tile services that together make up their "Lite"
basemap. For each theme, this tool fetches all three **live** and rewrites their `paint` colors
against that theme's own palette, producing three standalone, MapLibre-ready style JSONs per
theme — plus a reworked copy of the highway-shield and base-icon sprite icons, which (being
raster PNGs) can't be recolored through paint properties alone.

## Repo layout

```
config/
  services.json           # UGRC's 3 live endpoints - shared by every theme
  themes/
    <theme>/
      theme.json           # palette source + sprite transform + which sprites to rework (optionally from a different sprite sheet, with an icon-name remap)
      fallback.json         # how unmatched color properties are treated
      palette_extra.json    # this theme's own tokens with no equivalent in its live source
      services/
        LiteBase.json        # this theme's rules + background for one UGRC service
        LiteLabels.json
        VectorHillshade.json

docs/
  index.html               # the editor + compare demo - reads themes.json, no per-theme changes
  assets/
    styles.js              # style loading/merging/splitting, split out of index.html's own script
    dropdown.js            # the custom picker combobox, same reason
    colorpicker.js         # the shadcn/ui-style color popover, same reason
  themes.json              # generated: theme labels + where each one's style JSONs live
  <theme>/
    styles/UGRC_<Service>_<theme>.json
    sprites/{base-icons,shields}-<theme>.*
```

Adding a new theme means adding a `config/themes/<name>/` directory (see "Adding a theme"
below) — nothing under `src/` or `docs/` needs to change.

## Where the colors come from

Each theme's palette is built from its own **live** upstream source, resolved fresh at build
time (see [`src/ugrc_styles/palette.py`](src/ugrc_styles/palette.py)) plus a small set of
theme-specific tokens that source has no equivalent for
(`config/themes/<theme>/palette_extra.json`):

- **shadow** uses the literal color tokens `@protomaps/basemaps`' `namedFlavor("dark")` returns.
- **sol** uses colors read directly out of CARTO's public Voyager GL style JSON.

Similarly, UGRC's own three style definitions are never vendored into this repo — every build
fetches them fresh from UGRC's live ArcGIS endpoints (see
[`src/ugrc_styles/fetch.py`](src/ugrc_styles/fetch.py)). Only the *generated* style output is
committed, specifically so it can be used directly without running any code (see below).

## Using the output directly

`docs/<theme>/styles/UGRC_{VectorHillshade,LiteBase,LiteLabels}_<theme>.json` and
`docs/<theme>/sprites/{base-icons,shields}-<theme>.*` are committed, ready-to-use artifacts —
standalone MapLibre style JSON and sprite sheets, with absolute tile/sprite/glyph URLs already
filled in. Add all three style layers to a MapLibre map the same way you'd add UGRC's originals;
no light/original equivalent is published here, since UGRC's own live services are already
directly usable for that.

## I downloaded a style JSON from the editor — now what?

A style JSON isn't a picture of a map — it's a set of instructions ("draw roads this color, at
this width, starting at this zoom") that a map library reads and renders *live*, still pulling the
actual map data from UGRC's servers over the network. You need something that understands that
format to see anything.

**This file isn't locked to one renderer.** Esri's VectorTileServer (and so every style this repo
generates or the editor exports) implements the Mapbox GL Style Specification version 8, unmodified
— nothing in this repo's build or in the browser editor converts between a "Mapbox" and a
"MapLibre" version of a style; for the paint/layout properties these styles actually use, there's
no such conversion to make, since MapLibre GL JS is a spec-compatible fork of Mapbox GL JS from
before Mapbox's license change. So the same downloaded file works, unmodified, with MapLibre GL JS
(what the instructions below use), Mapbox GL JS, or Esri's own ArcGIS JS API — the one fixup below
is a source-URL shape Esri's own tools resolve automatically that *any* generic GL renderer (either
one) needs spelled out, not something specific to MapLibre.

**Fastest way to just look at it:** drop the file into
[Maputnik](https://maplibre.org/maputnik/), a free browser-based style editor — no install, no
code. If it complains about the tile source, that's the one UGRC-specific gotcha below; fix that
first and it'll load.

**To put it on your own web page**, you need [MapLibre GL
JS](https://maplibre.org/maplibre-gl-js/docs/) (free, open source, no server-side component) and
one small fixup first:

> **The one gotcha:** the downloaded style's vector source is shaped the way Esri's ArcGIS
> `VectorTileServer` publishes it (`"url": "https://tiles.arcgis.com/.../VectorTileServer/"`) —
> Esri's own tools resolve that automatically, but a generic GL renderer doesn't: MapLibre GL JS
> fails with `Failed to parse URL from tile/...`, and Mapbox GL JS fails the same way for the same
> reason. Rewrite it into the `tiles` array the GL spec expects before handing the style to
> `maplibregl.Map` (or `mapboxgl.Map`):
>
> ```js
> for (const [id, src] of Object.entries(style.sources)) {
>   if (src.type === "vector" && typeof src.url === "string") {
>     style.sources[id] = { ...src, tiles: [src.url + "tile/{z}/{y}/{x}.pbf"] };
>     delete style.sources[id].url;
>   }
> }
> ```
>
> (This is exactly what `toTilesSource()`/`prepareForRender()` in
> [`docs/assets/styles.js`](docs/assets/styles.js) do for the live editor above — copy that
> instead if you'd rather reuse tested code. One more minor wart from the same upstream data:
> the source's own `attribution` field is literally the placeholder text `"me"` — harmless, but
> worth overriding with your own `customAttribution` if you add MapLibre's attribution control.)

A complete, working page — save as `.html`, point `fetch()` at whichever file you downloaded, open
it in a browser:

```html
<!doctype html>
<html>
<head>
  <script src="https://unpkg.com/maplibre-gl@5.24.0/dist/maplibre-gl.js"></script>
  <link href="https://unpkg.com/maplibre-gl@5.24.0/dist/maplibre-gl.css" rel="stylesheet" />
  <style>body { margin: 0; } #map { position: absolute; inset: 0; }</style>
</head>
<body>
  <div id="map"></div>
  <script>
    fetch("./ugrc-lite-edited.json") // whatever you downloaded, next to this file
      .then((r) => r.json())
      .then((style) => {
        for (const [id, src] of Object.entries(style.sources)) {
          if (src.type === "vector" && typeof src.url === "string") {
            style.sources[id] = { ...src, tiles: [src.url + "tile/{z}/{y}/{x}.pbf"] };
            delete style.sources[id].url;
          }
        }
        new maplibregl.Map({ container: "map", style, center: [-111.891, 40.761], zoom: 10 });
      });
  </script>
</body>
</html>
```

**Combined vs. the 3 separate files:** unless you specifically need UGRC's own native
`VectorHillshade`/`LiteBase`/`LiteLabels` split (e.g. feeding a system that already expects that
exact shape), download the **combined** style — it's the single file the snippet above expects,
with nothing further to merge. The 3-file download reproduces UGRC's own per-service file shapes
exactly, which is only useful if something else consumes that shape directly; recombining
them into one usable style yourself means redoing the sprite-namespacing/source-merging the editor
already does internally (see `mergeStyles()` in `docs/assets/styles.js`) — reach for the combined
download instead unless you already know why you need the split one.

## Regenerating

```bash
uv sync
uv run ugrc-styles                                  # every theme -> docs/<theme>/{styles,sprites} + docs/themes.json
uv run ugrc-styles --theme shadow                    # just one theme (repeat --theme for more than one)
uv run ugrc-styles --base-url https://ar-puuk.github.io/ugrc-styles  # absolute sprite URLs for publishing
```

Run `uv run pytest` for the unit tests (color math, rule matching, config/palette plumbing).

## Adding a theme

1. `config/themes/<name>/theme.json` — label/description, a `palette_source` (currently
   `{"type": "protomaps", "flavor": ..., "version": ...}` or `{"type": "carto", "style_url": ...}`
   — see [`src/ugrc_styles/palette.py`](src/ugrc_styles/palette.py) to add another source kind),
   a `sprite_transform` (`"invert"` for a dark theme, `"none"` for a light-on-light one), and
   which services' sprites need reworking (usually `LiteBase` and `LiteLabels`, plus any exact
   `recolor` overrides an icon needs).
2. `config/themes/<name>/fallback.json` — the lightness band unmatched fill/line/circle colors
   get compressed into, and the tint unmatched text gets.
3. `config/themes/<name>/palette_extra.json` — tokens with no equivalent in the theme's live
   source (see the file's own `_about` for the discipline: nothing here may duplicate a value
   the live source already provides).
4. `config/themes/<name>/services/{LiteBase,LiteLabels,VectorHillshade}.json` — the actual
   `@token`-driven rules per source-layer. Usually ported from an existing theme's rules with
   the palette keys re-pointed at values that suit the new theme.
5. `uv run ugrc-styles --theme <name>` and eyeball the result in `docs/index.html` locally.
